# TCRLens: Structure-Aware Equivariant Graph Learning for TCR-pMHC-I Recognition and Immunogenic Epitope Discovery
We introduce TCRLens, a structure-aware deep learning framework that models residue-level interactions across five critical interface zones using multi-scale graph representations and an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN).
